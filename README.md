# Analysis of Covid-19 in Chile

### About this project
The plan is to make a dashboard that includes daily updated information about Covid-19 in Chile. The dashboard should include the following plots: 
* Daily infections in Chile including rolling average
* Daily deaths in Chile including rolling average
* Cases in comparison with other Latin American Countries
* Deaths in comparison with other Latin American Countries
* Map of Santiago de Chile with number of infections in the differenct city districs


### Data sources
* Main data source is the [John Hopkins University CSSE database](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
* Furthermore, the Chilean government provides daily [updated data also on a district level](https://github.com/MinCiencia/Datos-COVID19/). 

### More ideas:
* Single number with plotly to show the total confirmed cases/deaths: https://plotly.com/python/indicator/
* Plots indicating the confirmed cases/deaths per 100,000 inhabitants
